Welcome to the VEX EDR CAD Library for Autodesk Fusion 360

This CAD library was derived from the VEX resource library from Autodesk, with additional
content provided by team 7121E, Maverick Robotics.

Tutorials on how to import the files featured in this CAD library so they can be used in Fusion 360,
as well as how to use CAD effectively for robotic designs, can be found by looking up the playlist titled:
 "Vex w/ Fusion 360" on YouTube. Videos and playlist are uploaded on the "Aidan-7121E" YouTube channel. 
If you have any further questions on how to use Fusion 360 for robotics or run into any
issues regarding the use and or downloading of these files my contacts are as follow:

Discord: Hamiltonne#2339
Instagram: agpgreen {<--- you should totally send a follow request btw ;) }
Vex Forum: HamiltonnE

It is also recommened that once you have installed Fusion 360, imported this library, and start creating
designs, that you and your team mates also download the "A360" app off the iOS App Store or Android App 
Store. This app allows you to cleanly view and markup your 3D models and allows anyone on your team
to view your CADs easily. It's free to download, and is especially usefull if you need to see your design
during a meeting, but cant bring your computer with you.

With that said, have fun designing on Fusion! 7121E wants to wish you all good luck onthis 2019-2020: Tower
Takeover VRC Season!
